## To use this app
Go to [https://javisperez.github.io/tailwindcolorshades](https://javisperez.github.io/tailwindcolorshades)

## What is this?
Is a tool to make shades and tints for a given color and generate the proper code for the **TailwindCSS** config file.

The idea is to make the custom color generation a bit easier when creating custom color variants to use in your app's CSS.

## How to use it
Just place a name and a color on the inputs and will generate 3 tints and 3 shades for that given color. The name will be used to name the classes.

The inspiration for names and for the variants was inspired on Tailwind's defaults colors: [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors/](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors/)

After that you can copy/paste the generated colors into your Tailwind config file and start using them in your css.
